# Brand — the house style this repo ships with

> Style contract for every long-form video this repo produces. Every step-2+ skill (TSX overlays,
> full-screen animations, diagrams, SFX) reads this file so all videos feel like one channel.
> A calm, premium, modern **AI-studio** aesthetic (reference polish: Linear / Vercel / Anthropic).
>
> ### 👉 Make it yours: run **`/brand-setup`**
>
> This is the look the shipped example shots were built in. It's a real brand, not a placeholder —
> keep it if you like it. But **if you change nothing, your videos will look like someone else's
> channel.** `/brand-setup` interviews you and rewrites this file, `remotion/src/brand.ts` and
> `remotion/src/fonts.ts` **together**, then renders a proof card so you can see it. At minimum, set
> your own wordmark (§2).
>
> Editing by hand? Then you own the sync: this file, `brand.ts` (the same tokens as code) and
> `fonts.ts` (the families) must agree. Nothing errors when they drift — the docs just quietly stop
> describing the videos.

## 1. Identity & voice

- **Positioning:** modern **AI-studio** aesthetic — light, airy, whitespace, soft depth, tasteful
  motion. Reference polish: **Linear / Vercel / Anthropic**. Premium and calm, never loud or cluttered.
- **Voice:** direct, confident, generous (free resources), personal (the presenter in the loop). No
  hype-filler. On-screen text deliberately **avoids em-dashes** — keep that in overlays too.
- **Energy for video:** clean and premium, not MrBeast-loud. Motion is *tasteful*, not bouncy/cartoonish.
  (No hard offset shadows, thick black borders, or sticker-pop "Memphis" looks — that style is retired.)

## 2. Logo / wordmark

- **Wordmark:** your channel wordmark — set it once and reuse it as the brand lockup. It renders in
  three parts with the **middle part in the accent color**, in the display font, tight. Set it in
  `BRAND.wordmark` in `remotion/src/brand.ts` (`['Acme','Labs','']` for a two-part mark); `EndCard`
  and `BrandProof` read it from there, so one edit re-brands every card.
- No standalone logo mark is required (a favicon is enough). Use the wordmark as the lockup.
- Drop any portrait / brand-bumper assets you want to reuse under `media/library/` (e.g. a `logos/`
  or `faces/` entry) and reference them from shots via `staticFile('library/...')`.

## 3. Color palette (exact hex)

| Role | Name | Hex | Use in video |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary accent** | indigo | `#6366F1` | key words, highlights, active state, progress, CTAs, the accent word |
| Secondary accent | violet | `#9b7cc4` | pairs with indigo in gradients, secondary emphasis |
| Success / positive | teal | `#4db8a8` | "free", confirms, checkmarks, positive callouts |
| Success alt | green | `#4ecdc4` | teal companion for gradients/success |
| Warn / attention | yellow | `#f5d76e` | highlight sweeps, "watch this", attention pops |
| Danger / contrast | pink | `#e8879f` | errors, "the hard/expensive way", negative contrast |
| Ink (text/dark) | ink | `#1a1a2e` | primary text on light; base dark bg |
| Muted text | muted | `#6b6b7b` | secondary text, captions |
| Surface (paper) | paper | `#fffef7` | light full-screen bg, cards |
| Surface 2 (cream) | cream | `#faf8f5` | alt light band |

**Dark UI / terminal scale** (GitHub-ink — for Claude Code terminal & code mockups):
`#0d1117` (bg) · `#161b22` (panel) · `#30363d` (border) · `#8b949e` (dim text) · `#c9d1d9` (text).

**Signature gradient:** indigo → violet → teal (`#6366F1 → #9b7cc4 → #4db8a8`). Used for dividers and
full-screen animated backgrounds.

## 4. Typography (3-font system)

| Role | Font | Weights | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Display / headlines** | **Space Grotesk** | 500 / 600 / 700 | titles, big statements, section cards, the wordmark |
| **Body / UI** | **Inter** | 400 / 500 / 600 | subtitles, labels, body text, lower-third detail |
| **Code / mono** | **JetBrains Mono** | 400 / 500 / 700 | terminal mockups, code, prompts, file paths, tech labels |

All three load from `@remotion/google-fonts` (see `remotion/src/fonts.ts`) — nothing to install.
Headlines tight tracking; body normal; mono for anything literally code/terminal/paths.

## 5. Shape & depth

- **Radius:** ~14px (cards/panels), pills fully rounded. Terminal/code windows: ~10px with a title bar.
- **Depth:** **soft shadows** (e.g. `0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,.10)`), 1px light borders. Airy.
- **Never:** hard offset shadows (`4px 4px 0 #000`), 3px black borders, sticker/pop look → retired.
- **Window chrome** (browser/terminal mockups): rounded panel, top bar with 3 traffic-light dots
  + a mono label; content on the dark ink scale.

## 6. Motion language  ← *calm & premium*

Translated to video (Remotion, 60fps):

- **Entrances:** fade + rise. `opacity 0→1` and `translateY 24px→0` over ~14 frames (~0.23s), ease-out
  (or spring: damping 200, mass 0.8, stiffness 120). Calm, no overshoot/bounce.
- **Exits:** fade + fall ~10 frames.
- **Emphasis:** indigo highlight/underline wipe behind a key word over ~8 frames; scale pop max 1.03.
- **Stagger:** 3–4 frames between list items / lines.
- **Backgrounds:** slow drifting indigo/violet/teal gradient blobs + a faint dotted grid, 8–20s loops.
- **Feel:** premium, restrained, "Linear/Anthropic." No spins, no elastic, no hard snaps.

## 7. Video delivery specs

- **Canvas:** 3840×2160 (4K), **60 fps** — match the master cut's frame rate (the `video-1` example
  master is 4K60). (Design at 1920×1080 ×2 scale is fine; composite at 4K.)
- **Safe margins:** keep text ≥ 5% from edges (title-safe ~7.5%). Lower-thirds in the bottom ~12–18% band,
  left-aligned to the margin.
- **Talking head is CENTER-framed.** Overlays live in the **top and bottom bands**, or become
  **full-screen cutaways** (cut away from the presenter entirely to a full-screen TSX beat). Never cover
  the center-framed presenter.
- **Overlay types:** lower-third (name/term), keyword callout, full-screen statement/section card,
  animated diagram, UI/terminal mockup (TSX-first).
- **Visual editing rules** (honored by `/make-tsx`): concept beats = full-screen cutaways; overlays only
  for small persistent CTAs/badges; visuals sync to narration and never pre-empt it; real UI / real pages
  for config and service facts.
- **Captions:** overlays only (not word-level captions) for long-form.

## 8. Asset & source locations

- Master: `videos/<project>/reference/<cut>.mp4` · edited transcript:
  `videos/<project>/work/edited-transcript.json` (word times in the master timeline).
- Reusable brand assets: `media/library/` (typed folders — `logos/ sfx/ music/ faces/` each with an
  index/catalog). Per-video generated assets: `media/projects/<video>/`, referenced from shots as
  `staticFile('projects/<video>/x')`.
- Brand tokens as code: `remotion/src/brand.ts` · font families: `remotion/src/fonts.ts`. **These two
  and this file are one contract in three places — keep them in sync** (`/brand-setup` writes all
  three at once). Proof card: `npx remotion still src/index.ts BrandProof out/brand-proof.png --frame=95`.

## 9. Locked decisions & still-open

- **Brand = a modern AI-studio look** — indigo accent, 3-font system. ✓
- **Motion = calm & premium** — restrained fade-and-rise, no bounce (§6). ✓
- **Framing = centered** — overlays top/bottom band or full-screen cutaway; never cover center. ✓
- **SFX taste (step 4):** subtle premium accents. See §10.

*(Swap any of these for your own brand's decisions — this is the example channel's contract.)*

## 10. Sound design — SFX

Same energy as the motion: **calm/premium, felt-not-heard.** Reference feel is Linear / Anthropic /
Vercel product sound, NOT MrBeast-loud. SFX are seasoning on the edit, never the show.

**Choose every cue by its FUNCTION** (the pro-editor model — 3+1 foundational sounds do the heavy
lifting; thousands of files are a trap). Ask what the beat needs:

| Function | Sound | Its job | Our (calm) sub-types |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Motion** | whoosh | direction/speed; carry one shot into the next | `whoosh-soft` (quick cut), `whoosh-wind` (soft, gliding) |
| **Tension** | riser | "something is coming"; hold on the edge before a reveal | `riser-soft` (gentle; NO cymbal-urgency riser) |
| **Emphasis** | impact / pop | "this moment matters"; lands as the new shot appears | `impact-soft`, `impact-deep-soft` (reveal, long tail), `pop-reveal` (UI reveal) |
| **Snap** | click | small, satisfying, alive; a sequence of related shots each on a click | `ui-click-soft`, `ui-toggle-on`, `ui-send` |

Plus two brand-specific extras: `page-flip` (storybook) and `chime-reward` (the "free"/gift moment).

- **Taste — subtle premium accents.** Quiet, tasteful, always UNDER the voice. Silence is part of
  the mix; never wall-to-wall. Nothing ever pops louder than the voice.
- **Layer for the big moments (build-and-drop).** The magic is in stacking: **riser → impact** on a
  scripted reveal (e.g. "wait a few minutes … *boom*"), **whoosh → pop/impact** so a cut stands out.
  In the plan a layer is just two events at the same/adjacent `at_s` that sum. Reserve layering for the
  2–3 biggest moments; keep everything else single and sparse.
- **Density — key transitions, reveals, and tasteful click-sequences.** Score the signature moment of a
  beat, not every sub-frame. A click-sequence (3–4 related shots each on a click) counts as ONE gesture.
  Everything genuinely deniable is `"optional": true`.
- **Sync — to the VISUAL beat, and often the exact word.** A click on the toggle flip; a pop on the
  reveal; a whoosh on the cutaway; the impact on the drop word. Time off the shot's animation frames
  AND `edited-transcript.json` word times.
- **Levels.** Library clips are loudness-normalized to **~−20 LUFS** with a −1.5 dBFS peak ceiling, so a
  plan's per-cue `gain_db` is perceptually meaningful. The voice is ~−17 LUFS, so gain sets how far
  under it a cue sits: **payoffs ~−5/−6 · transitions ~−6/−8 · bed/texture ~−9/−11.** The SFX bus is
  **lightly ducked under the voice** (gentle sidechain, ~4 dB) in the audition mix; final
  polish/ducking/loudness is the final-mix step's job.
- **Signature motif.** Pick a recurring UI sound (the example uses a "Free Image Generator" toggle click
  — intro enable → later callback), the same `ui-toggle-on`, as a small sonic through-line.
- **What we deliberately do NOT do** (take the pro's *structure*, not the drama): cymbal-urgency risers,
  trailer-slam impacts, a whoosh on every movement, "funny" click+whoosh gags. **No static/glitch
  textures under narration** — glitch reads as NOISE over the voice at any gain; error/delete moments
  during speech get silence or one clean mechanical snap, never sustained static (save glitch textures
  for gaps where the voice is silent).
- **Source.** ElevenLabs **Sound Effects API** is primary (owned, consistent, reusable); curated
  royalty-free is the fallback. Every clip's `source` + `license` is recorded in the catalog.
- **Music.** No music bed in the SFX pass. Music (track selection + auto-ducking) is the final-mix step
  (`tools/gen_music.py` + `tools/mix_music.py`, drawing from `media/library/music/`).
- **Library is the durable asset.** Shared, cross-project at **`media/library/sfx/`** (`catalog.json` +
  `clips/`), seeded from `palette.json`, organized by function. It GROWS every video — reuse before
  generating (library-first). SFX that must live *inside* a Remotion shot go in `media/library/sfx/` via
  `staticFile()`.
